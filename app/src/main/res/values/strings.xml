    <string name="rule_2048">
        Objective: \n
        The goal of the game is to combine tiles with the same number to create a tile with the number 2048.\n\n

        Gameplay: \n
        Swipe the tiles to move them in any direction.
        When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one.
        After each move, a new tile will appear on the board. Keep combining tiles until you create a tile with the number 2048.\n\n

        Scoring: \n
        Your score is based on the value of the tiles you combine.
        Each time you combine two tiles, their value is added to your score.
        The game ends when you reach 2048, or when you can no longer make a move.\n\n
